I recently passed the [AZ-104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/) certification, making it the third Microsoft certification under my belt. I started with [AZ-900](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-fundamentals/), then [AZ-204](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-developer/) and recently [AZ-104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/).
I'm planning to get the [AZ-305](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/) and eventually the [AZ-400](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/devops-engineer/) soon™.

To get the certification you need to come up with an effective plan. Here below you can find the tips I use to get prepared to undergo a certification exam.

I'm using Azure daily so I was familiar with many of the certifications objectives, but not all of them. Having a developer background, I never configured Azure Active Directory for MFA, conditional access policies or Site-to-Site VPN connections for example.

I'm writing this article to explain how I prepared together with some tips I used, but remember that the preparation should be tailored to the way you learn. Different people learn in different ways and to be successful you need to figure out what works best for you.

## Study plan
I'm a full-time employee and I work 40 hours per week, so finding the time to study is not always easy, luckily for me though, here in The Netherlands the winter is quite depressing: It's dark when I leave home for the office and it's dark when I come back. This somehow helps me stay at home during the evening so I could dedicate some time to study and preparing for the certification.

My approach was studying around 1.5/2 hours every day and putting in 4 or 5 hours during the weekends. It took me around 1.5 months to prepare for the certification.

So my study plan was to put in around 15 hours per week. I wasn't studying every day to not get overwhelmed, so I kept some days off to relax and blow some steam off.

## Resources
Here's a list of resources I used to get prepared:

### [AZ-104 Study guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-104)
The Study guide is a great resource to check how familiar you're with a specific subject. From the study guide, I flagged the areas I was least familiar with and I started focusing on these first.

### [John Savill's AZ-104 Study cram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOod_VNgdJk)
This study cram was super useful to understand concepts I wasn't familiar with because John can explain concepts in a very easy-to-understand way. I used this one to kickstart my knowledge of Azure Active Directory configuration, VPN connections and to better understand how networking works in Azure.

### [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/?terms=104)
Contrary to many, I didn't complete the AZ-104 learning path. I found the study path too high level and not very useful, what I did instead was to use the study path to dive deeper using the resource usually listed at the end of the page.

In my opinion the learning path **does not prepare** you for the exam. Test questions go into a greater detail that the learning covers so, in my opinion, just skim over the learning path and rather spend more time on the resources you find at the end of each learning path module.

### [Azure free trial subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/)
Activate a trial subscription allowed me to try have hands-on experience with all the areas I wasn't very familiar with e.g. Azure Active Directory. An Azure trial subscription is free, you have 170.00 € of budget that will last for 30 days. Even though you have to insert your credit card details you won't be billed if you ran out of the free credit, all the services will be decommissioned if you don't upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go as per [Azure free account FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/free-account-faq/)

### Find a practice test
There're plenty of practice tests out there, some better than others so you have to put in some research to find a good one, and then go for it, it may cost you up to around 100.00 € but I still think it's worth it.

>Make sure you're not using dumps because it can invalidate all your certifications and prohibit you to take new ones ever again.

Microsoft sponsors the [MeasureUp](https://www.mindhub.com/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator-microsoft-official-practice-test/p/MU-AZ-104?utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=certpage&utm_campaign=msofficialpractice) one, if you wanna a safe bet, go with this.

## Tips
Here's a collection of tips that helped me get the certification.

### Plan the exam date as the first step
In order to not postpone taking the exam forever, I decided to plan the exam before starting to study. I did a bit of research to understand how much it takes to get ready for the exam, then gave me some more time and planned it. I ended up giving myself two months of time to prepare, this helped me to put the time in. 

Planning it in advance still allows you to change the exam date up to 24 hours before the exam, so it's not a strict deadline, but it still helped me to get prepared in time.

### Alternate your study routine
Mixing up your study routine can be beneficial as it helps to keep things interesting and can prevent boredom. Additionally, different study methods can appeal to different learning styles and can help to reinforce the material in different ways. For example, reading documentation may help to build a strong understanding of the theoretical concepts, while practice exams can help to build test-taking skills and identify areas where you need to improve. YouTube videos can be helpful in providing additional explanations and examples of the concepts that you are studying. So, switching up your routine can help to make the most of your study time and increase your chances of success.

### Carefully review wrong practice test answers 
While taking the practice test, carefully review your answers, especially the wrong ones. This may uncover some gaps in your knowledge and will give you an indication of where you need to spend some time on.

This point was especially important for me because I personally learn a lot more from a wrong answer than a correct one. Every time I give the wrong answer in the practice test, I dig deeper in the documentation and it really helps me master the subject better.

Whenever I get the same question wrong multiple times, I write down the question and the correct answer in a small document that I use to go over and over almost daily.

### Retake the same practice test twice
I found it very helpful to re-take the same practice test twice, possibly in the same day. Retaking the test in the same day can help to reinforce the material that you have studied and identify areas where you may still have difficulty. This can be helpful in focusing your study efforts and pinpointing areas where you need to spend more time studying. It's a good idea to retake the test after you have studied and covered the areas you were weak in, so that you can measure your improvement.

### Get hands-on experience
Hands on experience is very important. Having only theoretical knowledge derived from the documentation may not be enough for this exam so I advise you to spend some time on practicing what you're learning with the free account.
This can be unvaluable to get familiar with the az cli or PowerShell cmdlet. You can do so using the Azure Cloud Shell so you don't even need to install anything on your PC.

### Enjoy the journey
The added value of a certification in my opinion is not the certification badge, but rather all the knowledge you accrue preparing for the actual exam.

## The exam
The exam I went through had 49 questions and I had 1 h and 40 minutes to complete it. The exam started with a case study comprised of 6 questions.
I found the level of difficulty of the exam resonable, all the questions were clear and easy to understand. The time for me was enough, but if you find yourself running out of time you can skip the question you're not sure of using the review functionality, so you can go through them at the end.

>Please note that you can't review questions from the case study.

## Summary
In this article I wanted to share my approach to prepare for a certification exam together with some tricks I used to get ready in a reasonable amount of time and how to figure out what are the knowledge gaps you may have.

To sum up, I wanna point out that this is what worked well for me. It's not guaranteed that this approach works equally well for you, but I hope I explained some of the things you can do to prepare for the certification exam.

I hope you find this helpful, if you have any questions/suggestions don't hesitate to leave a comment below.

Till the next time.
