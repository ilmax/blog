Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Massimiliano, and I am a software engineer and cloud architect with a passion for all things tech. I was born and raised in Italy, but I have had the opportunity to live and work in the Netherlands, where I currently reside.

I have been working as a developer since 2008, and in that time, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects across various industries. As a developer, I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I specialize in Azure, .NET, C#, and other cloud-based technologies, and I have a particular interest in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and DevOps practices. I am also a firm believer in the importance of Cloud Native principles, and I enjoy working on projects that leverage the power of cloud computing to deliver high-performing, scalable solutions.

In addition to my professional experience, I am also proud to have earned several certifications that demonstrate my expertise in my field. These include an Azure certification and a Terraform certification, both of which I have worked hard to achieve and maintain.

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find the content here helpful and informative, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about tech.
